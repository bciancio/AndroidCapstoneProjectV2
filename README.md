# AndroidCapstoneProjectV2

Project purpose:
The purpose of this project is create a mobile specific user interface to interact with my java restful web service.

###### 11/17/2015 Progress Notes

- I've gotten both the fragments wired up.
- Currently working on populating the RecyclerView ListFrag
- Getting failure when I make a request to my service? Ask lori?

11/17/2015 - 11/27/2015
- Been working on the web service side of the application.
- The webservice at this time is just missing a delete transaction from database.
- Working on hardcoding a transactions object with some data to get a working recycler view.
- Will be looking more into how to call the webservice.
- The webservice is hosted on Heroku. The webservice uses clearDbMySql for the database.
